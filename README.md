# What is this repo about?
Hi guys! This repo contains my first self-study project in Front-end area, namely a simple, concise and stylish landing page. The project is made only in the desktop version, using vanilla css, flexbox, and a slick slider. Since the Figma layout is still in the works, there may be some differences between my deployed version and the original.

You can explore my version by <a href="https://fe-ss-1-qwery.netlify.app/">clicking here</a>.

And also you can see the original Figma layout by clicking on this image ðŸ‘‡
